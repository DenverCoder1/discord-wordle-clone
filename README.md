## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be specified in a `.env` file to configure the bot for self-hosting:

- `TOKEN`: The token for the bot.
- `GUILD_IDS` (optional): A comma-separated list of guild IDs to activate slash commands in. (This is for testing since global slash commands can take a while to register.)
